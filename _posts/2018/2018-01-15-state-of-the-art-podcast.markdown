I had the pleasure of [speaking on the State of the Art podcast](https://art19.com/shows/state-of-the-art/episodes/92a50b6a-c227-48a7-863a-56f754078146).

_Daniel’s experience with art is a far cry from what most of us have encountered. Growing up in the Soviet Union his father would use books to take care of the family’s needs. In Daniel’s life art has been his currency, his healthcare, his passion and now part of his career. In this episode, Ethan and Daniel talk about what art is going to be in the future, how artists are entrepreneurs, and how the experience around art will change._
