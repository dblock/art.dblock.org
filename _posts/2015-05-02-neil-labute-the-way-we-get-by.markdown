Neil Labute's ["The Way We Get By"](http://2st.com/shows/current-production/the-way-we-get-by) was meh. Unlike ["Filthy Talk for Troubled Times"](/2010/06/08/filthy-talk-for-troubled-times.html) or the much acclaimed Fat Pig, the plot took 45 minutes to take off and I found the characters particularly annoying and completely unrealistic. The play has a great ending, I wished it had a great beginning.
