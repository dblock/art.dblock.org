Went to see [The Break of Noon](http://geffenplayhouse.com/more_info.php?show_id=17) with Fox Mulder David Duchovny and Amanda Peet at the MCC last week. I only mention movie stars, since we all are trained to have low expectations from their performance as most movie actors suck at theatre, given the lack of retouching and artificial amplification of their voice. Duchovny did a fine job at his key role though (and so did the rest of the cast). The story was good, the ending - quite clever, and the play deserves a nice round of applause.
