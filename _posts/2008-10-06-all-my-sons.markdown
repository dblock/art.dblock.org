It took me a couple of weeks to decide whether I liked All My Sons. I am, naturally, not questionning Arthur Miller's writing. I liked some dramatic elements of the production. And Even Katie Holmes was a good fit for the role of Ann Deever. But overall, I walked out of the play disappointed. It was a stage away from other serious plays, including the monumental Doubt. It's not enough to put some truly talented actors together - their sum must add up to more than a collection of individuals. From Broadway, I expect and demand a whole lot more.
