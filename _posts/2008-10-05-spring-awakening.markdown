I feel paralized when a musical gets grander every minute. I forget everything, embraced by the show. I expect a trembling voice, a tone to break, a bump. But there will be none. I am sitting right in the middle of center orchestra row B, falling in love with the tiny Wendla (Alexandra Socha). She sounds absolutely and perfectly crystal clear. And she is just one of all the very young and talented cast of Spring Awakening - a sad story, a difficult script. A challenge and a complete success.
