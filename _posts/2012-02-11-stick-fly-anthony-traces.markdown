With three shows in just over a month I didn’t get a moment to blog about them.

Saw [Stick Fly](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/09/theater/reviews/stick-fly-at-the-cort-theater-review.html) on Broadway a few weeks ago, a show produced by Alicia Keys. It was a solid play, but maybe a tidbit long. There weren’t too many clichés as you may expect from a play that explores issues that “everyone can relate to”. Looks like it’s closing.

Dans un tout autre registre, Anthony and the Johnsons, which I discovered via the “Hercules and Love Affair” album years ago, gave a monumental one-time performance called [“Swanlights”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhxO_Cn9n5A) at Radio City Music Hall, commissioned by the MOMA. It was a much anticipated, hugely depressing, painful and beautiful show. The standing ovation lasted fifteen minutes to a closed curtain.

Finally, we went to see [Traces](http://7doigts.com/en/shows/6-traces) last night by a troupe called [7 Fingers](http://7doigts.com/en), currently playing at the Union Square Theatre. It was a fantastic show with some impressive dancing mixing street and circus. It’s the “real deal”, some critics have written. I concur. Highly recommended.
