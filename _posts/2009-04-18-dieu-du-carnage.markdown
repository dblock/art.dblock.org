Yasmina Reza's [God of Carnage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_of_Carnage) on Broadway featuring James Gandolfini (Tony Soprano) in a minor role. More seriously, this is a play with four actors and Jeff Daniels had the hardest part of all, having to follow multiple evolving story lines. It was quite funny and, sadly, rather true.
