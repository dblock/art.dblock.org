I've long watched my inspiring friends make generative art and mint NFTs. I own a handful of works on paper by [Dmitri Cherniak](https://linktr.ee/dmitricherniak), and we've [briefly collaborated in 2019](https://www.instagram.com/p/BtuX53IHMBx/) - Dmitri made digital works, and I drew a smaller set inspired by his output. I really enjoyed observing his process, and thought about trying making digital drawings myself, but then I stubbornly stuck to making my own works on paper. Dmitri's recent success with [Ringers](https://opensea.io/assets/art-blocks?search%5BstringTraits%5D%5B0%5D%5Bname%5D=Ringers&search%5BstringTraits%5D%5B0%5D%5Bvalues%5D%5B0%5D=All%20Ringers) selling at crazy prices was not overnight. He has long made, and believed in generative art, he's a true artist that doesn't care much about commercial success. Nevertheless, the $ outcomes are worthy of a mention, his art is now being recognized by collectors outside of the traditional gallery system.

Last week, after listening to a conversation with [Osinachi](https://twitter.com/osinachiart), an incredibly inspiring Nigerian artist that has been minting NFTs for a while, I finally decided to give generative art NFTs a go, listed [work 1/10](https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/48718886585399041049872855307944290111042886289234588241181420742469385977857) in an auction, and sold my first NFT to my first bidder, someone I didn't know!
