Went to see Labyrinth Theater Company's "Unconditional" on Friday at Public Theater and loved it. The play told many stories of race, sex, love and murder, well tied together and set in an arena-like stage where the audience seated in different areas gets a completely different view of the play, the story and sometimes the characters.
