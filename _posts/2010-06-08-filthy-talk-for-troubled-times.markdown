Went to see [“Filthy Talk for Troubled Times”](http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/214955) last week. This was a benefit performance at the Lucille Lortel Theatre followed by a nice party at a rooftop loft on the west side overlooking the Hudson. Neil LaBute along with the cast, including Craig Bierko, Alice Eve, Johnny Galecki, Josh Hamilton, Julia Stiles and Justin Long, were all there chatting and having a drink. I exchanged a few words with Julia and a handshake with Neil. We chatted with Robert LuPone for half an hour on a comfortable couch. I remember all these people and they probably don’t remember me, but I am reminded every other day how nice it is to be in New York and be able to cross paths or even have a real conversation with recognizable people.

The play was short and sweet, but a bit dated (it was written twenty years ago). Alice Eve was my favorite.
