Someone who travelled from the U.K. to U.S.S.R. made me a mix tape in 1986 with a few British hits. I was living in Moscow. To give you some perspective, I must have had less than twenty tapes then and all were 3rd or 4th copies of the original. I used to play them on my Элекроника 302, one of the first mass-produced Russian tape recorders. We had LPs and my dad had a few tapes too, mostly the Beatles and Adriano Celentano. I had a Scorpions album and an Iron Maiden one, my crown jewels.

This mix tape was awesome. I would later learn that it included the original version of <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self_Control_(song)'>Raf’s “Self Control”</a>, made popular by Laura Branigan and other songs I didn’t like as much. The second song on Side A remained a mystery, and nobody could tell me who it was. I finally lost the tape when I moved from Seattle to New York in 2006, before Shazam could identify it. It was gone and lost forever.

I remembered some lyrics and kept searching on-and-off, for YEARS. Today I found it [here](http://www.lyrics.net/lyric/785016) on Lyrics.net. The song was by Marylin Martin and it’s called “Night Moves”. It’s [on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGD77VsaCLs), including a [live version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqO_hdGDZ5g).
