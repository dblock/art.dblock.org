A very exciting addition to my private collection dug up from a family basement, another [Ernst Neizvesti](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Neizvestny) (Эрнст Неизвестный) drawing to add to [this one](/2009/10/27/ernst-neizvestni.html). He was a friend of my grandfather and writer Lev Davydov (Lomberg). Ernst Neizvestni lives in New York, but I have never met him.
