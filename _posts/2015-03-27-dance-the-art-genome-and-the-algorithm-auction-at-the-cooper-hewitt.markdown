[Kate Sicchio](https://twitter.com/sicchio) and I have been collaborating on a little dance project called [Dance the Art Genome](github.com/dblock/dance-the-art-genome). It premiered at the Ruse Labs after-party for the Artsy Algorithm Auction, held at the Cooper Hewitt Museum. Performed by Kim Machaby.
