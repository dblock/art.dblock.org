Saw [Fences](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fences_%28play%29) last night on Broadway with Viola Davis and Denzel Washington, among others. Sitting a row away from us was Jesse Jackson and two rows in front of us, Chris Webber. There were other celebrities that were minor compared to these two, so I wonâ€™t mention them.

The show was pretty good, especially if you like human drama. I liked the very clearly played divide between the characters willingly stuck in the past and those unable to move on with the future because of them. I think Denzel did a good job at being a stage actor (unlike other celebrities that failed), but it was a little strange not to have a zoom into his face and amplified sound from most of his movies.
