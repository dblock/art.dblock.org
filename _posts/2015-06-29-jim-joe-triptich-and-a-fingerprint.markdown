A Jim Joe triptich, from my personal collection. I bought these directly from him, although we never met and the exchange was made via doorman and delivery in 2011 or so.

And the classic Mona-Lisa, much like my [big one](/2011/07/12/jim-joe.html).

Finally, this one has Jim Joe's fingerprint!

These came along with [the other Jim Joes](/2015/06/10/jimjoe-official-and-please-thank-you.html) in 2011.
