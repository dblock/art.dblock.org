Saw an awesome off-Broadway play a couple of weeks ago, [Covers](http://www.nationalyiddishtheatre.org/productions/covers).

> “An engaging psychological work of theater, COVERS paints a revealing portrait of an unusual family, while exploring the difficult choices made that have defined their pasts and are destined to influence their futures.”
