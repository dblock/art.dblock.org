I am a big fan of finding non-standard, creative solutions to typical problems that can easily be solved with a bit of cash. For example, one of my house projects included [hanging large drawings with plexiglass](/2007/12/18/big-frame-hanging.html).

Having recently moved I needed a hanging rod for a small loft space attached to the ceiling (the width of the space is unusual and standard rod sizes don't fit). The loft height is 6 ft., so I also wanted something thin and giving the place a bit of character. Here's what I came up with.

* [5/8 in. x 72 in. Zinc Plated Threaded Rod](http://www.homedepot.com/p/Crown-Bolt-Everbilt-5-8-in-x-72-in-Zinc-Plated-Threaded-Rod-800837/204325653), $14.98
