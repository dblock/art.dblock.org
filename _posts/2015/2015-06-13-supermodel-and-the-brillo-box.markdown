I you want to learn about the economics of the art world I can't recommend these two books by Don Thomson enough.

* [The 12MM$ Stuffed Shark](http://www.amazon.com/The-Million-Stuffed-Shark-Contemporary/dp/0230620590)
* [The Supermodel and the Brillo Box](http://www.amazon.com/The-Supermodel-Brillo-Box-Contemporary/dp/1137279087)

I think the next book will be about the Internet. Here's a quote from the last chapter of "The Supermodel and the Brillo Box".
