Malevich painted his _Red Square_ in 1915, entitled _Painterly Realism of a Peasant Woman in Two Dimensions_. The _Black Square_ and the _Black Circle_ preceded that in 1913. The movement (the displacement) finally combined in the _Black Square and Red Square_ painting.

Humbly paying a tribute to the square.
