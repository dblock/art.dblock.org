Saw Neil La Bute's "Reasons to be Pretty" yesterday. I liked the fact that the plot is a raw, predictable story with no twists and turns. Every single element has been played before, maybe not together. So, just like a model makes the clothes look better - the prettier the model, the better clothes look, this play gets better and better with stronger actors.
