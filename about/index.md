<br><small>Sterling Ruby, Spr√ºth Magers, Berlin, 2016</small>

I am a Russian-born, New York-based technologist and artist. I learned to draw in Moscow, former USSR. I am equally interested in technology and art, so my job, CTO of an art company, [artsy.net](https://www.artsy.net), is fitting. This blog catalogues my own work, including [large sanguine drawings](/2015/01/02/large-sanguine-drawings.html), [photography](/2015/01/01/photography.html), [works in my private collection](/tags/private%20collection/), [routine figure drawing](/tags/drawing/) and [many more art-related topics](/tags/).
