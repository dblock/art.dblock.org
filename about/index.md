Daniel Doubrovkine (aka dB.) is a Russian-born, New York-based artist. He learned to draw in Moscow, former USSR. He has also spent a short while in the Pacific Northwest.

_I believe that color often hides the essence of a person, that it exists merely to accentuate contrast and attract the eye. Hence, I am faithful to monotone sanguine. On a tangent, living in small spaces in a big city, I keep running out of drawing space. My work combines those two ideas and consists mostly of human-size conte crayon sanguine drawings on paper._

This blog catalogues my own works, works in my collection and some art-related topics.
